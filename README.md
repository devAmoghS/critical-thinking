# critical-thinking

### Evaluate the cause -
1. look at the symptom that is problematic. 
2. Then figure out the real reason it's happening. 
3. Come at the possible symptom from different perspective.
4. Once you generate the recommendation.
5. Stop and think critically what new problems could be caused if we were to implement that recommendation.

1.When you go about solving a problem, think backwards about the causes, think forward about the consequences 
2.Look at the causes and think backwards to make sure that you are not solving the symptoms, but solving the problem.

### Breaking bigger problems into smaller pieces
1. What is the big problem composed of ?
2. Which are the smaller issues that are driving the big problem ?

### Pop Quiz
*************************
##### You start on a new project that seems very similar to previous work you've done. You immediately dive in and proceed as you have done before. Why is your bold start probably a mistake?
###### You should take time to think critically about the scope of the project.
Issues such as identifying stakeholders, information sources, bottlenecks, and lag times should be clarified.

*************************

##### When do you know that you have broken down a problem sufficiently?
###### when solutions begin to become obvious
When a problem becomes small, it often becomes simple.

*************************

#### Your team has completed writing recommendations for solving a major problem in your business unit. How can you make implementation go smoothly?
##### by anticipating unintended consequences
The recommendations may cause more problems than they solve.

*************************

#### Why do people tend to rush off and start solving the problem without understanding causes and consequences first?
##### It makes them feel like they're being responsive to stakeholders.
While it's great to want to be responsive to stakeholders, they're more interested in seeing you solve the true root causes, rather than just getting busy with problem solving.

### Define the problem statement -
#### The problem statement defines what is the destination where we can say the project was a success.

#### What is a problem statement composed of ?
1. Outline the goals
2. Set the boundaries on the problem solving space
3. Define the success criteria
4. Acknowledge the constraints bound to the problem
5. Spell out the assumptions attached with the problem
6. Identify the stakeholders for which the problem statement is solved
7. Establish the timelines

#### Understand the real question
1. Seek to understand why a solution is needed.
2. Understand from a stakeholder perspective what consequences will the problem have, if it persists
3. Avoid solving the symptoms and try to identify the problem. This way you could come out with the most valuable recommendation

### Ask the focussing questions
1. What is the real question ?
2. Who are the stakeholders ?
3. How will you measure success ?
4. What is the scope of the problem ?
5. What are the constraints you are facing ?

### Examining past efforts
1. Was this problem addressed in the past ?
2. What is different now vs. then ?
3. Were there any challenges last time this was addressed that we need to think about now ?
4. What are the assumptions that are limiting us ?
5. Who were involved with this problem the last time ?

### Using new lenses to think critically
1. Can we change the point of view ?
2. Can we change the context ?
3. Can you change reality ?

#### Focusing questions help you _____ a problem space.

Focusing questions help you define the problem space and put boundaries on it. Without boundaries, your problem solving will be unfocused and inefficient

*************************

#### You have a very efficient and reliable team member on your team, but they are infamous for treating symptoms rather than root causes. What is the likely outcome of using their quick assistance?
##### Any fix provided will be short-lived.
The team will likely have to live with undesirable and unintended consequences.

*************************

#### Causality involves digging down to uncover root causes as well as considering the _____ of potential solutions.

#### Your manager asks you to examine a new operational problem from the point of view of a customer. You are not clear on where to begin. How can you make a quick start on this task?
##### by interviewing a few customers
This is the most direct way to get insight into another point of view.

*************************

#### Your team is being asked to revisit a project that they completed three years ago. Which question should they address to clarify the problem definition?
##### What circumstances have changed since three years ago?
In order to best understand the problem, you need to understand how the situation has evolved.

### Challenge how the business runs
Assess how does the following operate :

+  **Business model**

+ **Cost** 
1. how do you reduce the drag of business ?
2. How you operate your business with 2/3 of the current human resources ?
3. How would you eliminate your job ?

### How would you eliminate your job

2. What work should you delegate to other members of the team ?
3. What work could you automate ?

1. What is the most wasteful activity we do as an organisation ?

### Using the five whys of critical thinking
Asking the five whys will lead you to insight

### Answering the seven so-whats of critical thinking
This is a thinking tool that reveals the consequence of an action. It will lead you to all the implications and future consequences of an action

### Using the 80 / 20 rule
What are the major drivers of the impact ? We want to chase the 20% of the drivers creating 80% of the impact.
* So, look at whatever problem you're trying to solve, understand what the drivers are, and understand how much each driver contributes to the overall impact you're trying to have. 
* Spend your time solving for those issues, the ones that have a disproportionate impact on the metric you're trying to move. 
* It'll be a much more efficient use of your time, and you're going to solve the biggest problems your organization faces first.
