# critical-thinking

### Evaluate the cause -
1. look at the symptom that is problematic. 
2. Then figure out the real reason it's happening. 
3. Come at the possible symptom from different perspective.
4. Once you generate the recommendation.
5. Stop and think critically what new problems could be caused if we were to implement that recommendation.
