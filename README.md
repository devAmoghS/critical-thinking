# critical-thinking

### Evaluate the cause -
1. look at the symptom that is problematic. 
2. Then figure out the real reason it's happening. 
3. Come at the possible symptom from different perspective.
4. Once you generate the recommendation.
5. Stop and think critically what new problems could be caused if we were to implement that recommendation.

1.When you go about solving a problem, think backwards about the causes, think forward about the consequences 
2.Look at the causes and think backwards to make sure that you are not solving the symptoms, but solving the problem.
